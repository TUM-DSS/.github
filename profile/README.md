### Research Group - Optimization, Learning, and Market Design
Market design uses economic theory, mathematical optimization, systems design, experiments, and empirical analysis to design market rules and institutions. 
Fundamentally, market design asks how the design of the rules and regulations of a market affects the functioning and outcomes of that market. 
The study includes auction markets, but also markets without money such as matching markets, which found application in the assignment of students to courses or in school choice programs. 
We are contributing to various strands in this literature including optimization in market design, equilibrium computation, mechanism design, and experiments.
